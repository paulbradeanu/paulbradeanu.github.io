<p>Hi, I'm Paul and this is my <font color = "#004080">html</font> tutorials website. There I will post the basic commands of the <font color = "#004080">html</font> language script and maybe in the future I will show you how to make a website too. If you see the <font color = "#004080">html</font> language script for the first time, Probably you would think this is hard, but believe me, this is very easy. You just need some time to learn and practice the commands and it will be very simple for you.</p>

<p>Today I want to teach you how to script <font color = "#004080">html</font> too. First of all, you need to know the basics. To make a working <font color = "#004080">html</font> command, you have to put it into "<font color = "#595959">< ></font>". These must be before and after the text, but after it, put a "<font color = "#595959"">/</font>" in front of the command to end it. I know it seems hard, but it's really easy. Let me show you some commands and I will explain you how to use them.</p>
<p>First of all, let's try to edit the size and the font of the text. I will use this sentence: <font color = "#595959">I love the Internet</font>.</p>
<p><img src = "tutorial 1.png" height = "200px" width = ""></p>
<p>The first command (with the "<font color = "#595959">font size</font>") is for the size of the text, and the secound command (with the "<font color = "#595959">font face</font>") is for the font of it. As you saw, for the "<font color = "#595959">font size</font>" I used "<font color = "#595959">10</font>", but you can use what number you want, and for the "<font color = "#595959">font face</font>" I used the "<font color = "#595959">Arial</font>" font, but there are a lot more fonts that you can use.</p>

<p>Now, I want to show you how to change the look of you text with the "<strong><font color = "#595959">bold</strong></font>", "<em><font color = "#595959">italic</em></font>", and "<u><font color = "#595959">underlined</u></font>" add-ons.</p>
<p>As always, I will put there a picture with the script and I will explain you it.
<p><img src = "tutorial 2.png" height = "200px" width = ""></p>
<p>For the first add-on (the "<strong><font color = "#595959">bold</strong></font>" one), I used the "<strong><font color = "#595959">strong</strong></font>" command, for the secound add-on (the "<em><font color = "#595959">italic</em></font>" one), I used the "<em><font color = "#595959">em</em></font>" command, and for the third add-on (the "<u><font color = "#595959">underlined</u></font>" one), I used the "<u><font color = "#595959">u</u></font>" command.</p>
<p>You can use the "<strong><font color = "#595959">bold</strong></font>" text for the titles or important things, the "<em><font color = "#595959">italic</em></font>" text for the quotes, and the "<u><font color = "#595959">underlined</u></font>" text for the marked things.</p>

<p>What about some colors? I think it would look beautiful!</p>
<p>The colors are very easy to be added. The command is "<font color = "#595959">font color</font>". I will show you the script and I will tell you more about the colors.</p>
